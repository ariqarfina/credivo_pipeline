# **Credivo Data Pipeline**

## Project Overview:
Credivo, like many modern companies, deals with a lot of data from different sources. This data can help make smart decisions and find important insights, but it's hard to use effectively. The another issues is the lack of Data Quality, and the stakeholders is don't have any access to check the quality of Data. To fix this, Credivo knows it needs a better data pipeline for managing data. This pipeline will organize the data better, making it easier to use and trust. With this pipeline, Credivo wants to give its team the right information at the right time, so they can make better decisions and make the company better overall.
